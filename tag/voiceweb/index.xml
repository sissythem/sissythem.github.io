NLU/NLP applications. Additionally, I was responsible for the redesign and implementation
of the company’s products (Dialog Manager and NLI platform) to follow the micro-services
architecture paradigm. I have implemented various improvements on the application’s
datalayer, created a Rule Engine using MongoDB in the backend - the product was parsingXMLs
for rule extraction, implemented a completely new RESTful Web Service for the Dialog
Manager application. Moreover, I have redesigned and implemented a new UI from scratch for
the NLI platform product.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Technologies used included Python, Java, Spring Framework, Spring MVC, RESTful and SOAP web services, Vaadin and others&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
