abstract: "The DARE platform is designed to live in-between user applications and the underlying com-
puting resources. It is built on top of containerisation as well as parallelisation technologies,
e.g., Kubernetes and MPI. Interfacing with client systems and end-users is achieved via REST-
ful APIs. The execution of scientific workflows is achieved via a Workflows-as-a-service layer,
which can handle workflows described in either the dispel4py Python library (Filgueira, Krause,
Atkinson, Klampanos, & Moreno, 2017), or in the Common Workflow Language (CWL) (Am-
stutz et al., 2016)."
