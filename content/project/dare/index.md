The DARE platform provides all the necessary tools to research developers to develop and execute their experiments written using either the fine-grained workflow specification library dispel4py or CWL. Moreover, the DARE platform offers data provenance to the users so as to track and analyze their data. The DARE platform is cloud-ready, integrating containerized software applications running on top of Kubernetes. Kubernetes enables automated deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications. Research developers can interact with the DARE platform by making use of its RESTful API. DARE API is a composition of RESTful Web APIs exposed by the containerized versions of the underlying DARE platform components.
