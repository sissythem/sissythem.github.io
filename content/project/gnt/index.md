I worked as a Software Engineer implementing multiple projects using Java EE/Spring 
frameworks for backend services(EJB3,Spring Framework, Hibernate, RESTful and SOAP 
web services), with test-driven approach (JUnit and integration tests). 
Participated also in UI projects written with Vaadin and Android frameworks.
