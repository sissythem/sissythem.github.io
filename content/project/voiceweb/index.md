I worked as a Software Engineer designing and developing speech recognition and 
NLU/NLP applications. Additionally, I was responsible for the redesign and implementation 
of the company’s products (Dialog Manager and NLI platform) to follow the micro-services 
architecture paradigm. I have implemented various improvements on the application’s 
datalayer, created a Rule Engine using MongoDB in the backend - the product was parsingXMLs 
for rule extraction, implemented a completely new RESTful Web Service for the Dialog 
Manager application. Moreover, I have redesigned and implemented a new UI from scratch for 
the NLI platform product.
- Technologies used included Python, Java, Spring Framework, Spring MVC, RESTful and SOAP web services, Vaadin and others
