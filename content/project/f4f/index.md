I worked in the FAIR4Fusion project as a Software Engineer. The project's goal was to 
make European (or nationally when permitted) funded data more widely available to the 
fusion community, other science communities, funding bodies, and the public at large in 
order to maximise the impact of, the data and demonstrate the importance of the work 
done at relevant sites. I was involved in the development of a demonstrator, written in
python using the Django Framework.
